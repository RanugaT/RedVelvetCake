1.Sooo we have to start by making the dough, so to make the dough you need some water and yeast(like a yeast extract or something).

2.Then we have to get a bowl and fill it with water, then put the yeast in it. Wait for it to get good. Then cover it with a cloth or something and wait for it to get bigger/expand.

3.When it finally becomes big take it out and put it on a pizza pan, a pizza pan thats circular and thin, then rub the pizza with your fingers until it reaches the edges of the pan.

4.Thats when you have to put sauce on it. Grab a spoon or something to put the sauce on the pizza, put sauce until the entire pizza dough is covered.

5.Then you have to put the cheese, as much as you want as long as it covers the whole pizza. Then you have to put pepperoni or whatever topping(s) you want. After that you can either put a little cheese on top or follow the next step.

6.Grab the pizza pan and put it in the oven, put to about 375 Degrees Farenheit for about 30 minutes. If it doesnt look good enough when it comes out put it for another 5-10 minutes. After that wait for it to cool a little bit (1-5 Minutes). 

7.Cut into as many slices as you want, usually me and my family cut it into 8 slices but whatever you want is fine. After all that EAT IT. 

P.S Remember it doesnt have to be good, what matters is that you tried your best! Practice makes perfect so the more you make the better it will be! So this is how to make Pepperoni Pizza!
